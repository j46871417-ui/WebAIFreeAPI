- Added microphone recording in the composer; transcripts are inserted into the message box for review before sending.
- Added local `/api/voice/status` and `/api/voice/transcribe` endpoints.

- Persisted DeepSeek feature tokens during login/refresh so search keeps working after restart.
- Enabled provider web search for Qwen agent mode when the search toggle/default is active.

## 0.1.31

- Added a visible Anthropic-compatible API block in Settings for desktop and VS Code webview.
- Exposed `/v1/messages` URL and Anthropic auth header guidance next to provider API keys.
- Enabled Anthropic CORS headers for `x-api-key`, `anthropic-version`, and `anthropic-beta`.
- Passed smart-search intent through desktop, VS Code webview, and compatible API prompts so current/news requests use provider web search instead of falling back to "no internet access".
